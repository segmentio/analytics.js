This repo should be kept in sync with upstream segment version.  The only thing we change here is component.json and integrations.js.  The dependency for `analytics.js-integration-astronomer` should point to our github integration repo.

To Build:
-   Make sure our integration master branch is up to date.
-   `make clean && make build`
