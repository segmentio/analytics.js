# Analytics.js

Analytics.js makes it easy to collect customer data and send it to many different tools using a single, unified API.

Analytics.js is open source and is one of the libraries that powers [Segment], the managed, hassle-free way to collect customer data in the browser and beyond.

For our mobile and server-side data collection libraries, check out our [libraries] page.

## Documentation

First, read the [Analytics.js QuickStart], which contains installation instructions and a brief overview of what Analytics.js does and how it works.

For more detail on the Analytics.js API, check out the [Analytics.js Library Reference].


## Contributing

This repository houses a pre-built, open-source version of analytics.js. The core logic of analytics.js is broken out into individual repositories:

- To report an issue with analytics.js itself, head over to [analytics.js-core][], where the core analytics.js logic is maintained.
- To report an issue with an integration. head over to the [analytics.js-integrations][] organization, where we keep each integration in its own repository.

If you're not sure where to open an issue, feel free to open an issue against this repository or email <friends@segment.com> and we'll help point you in the right direction.
