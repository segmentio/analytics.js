That's where **analytics.js** comes in! Instead of adding hooks for every single analytics service you integrate, you add a single set of provider-agnostic hooks that then route to any analytics service you want!\r\n\r\nThe API is dead simple—you definitely won't want to go back to using those unfriendly third-party APIs!\r\n\r\n\r\n## The API\r\nOur goal for the API was to pave over the small differences in all your analytics services to give you a single calls.\r\n\r\n### initialize()\r\nTo start using **analytics.js**, call `initialize` with the analytics services you want to enable. That looks like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nanalytics.initialize({\r\n    'Google Analytics' : 'UA-XXXXXX-XX',\r\n    'Segment.io'       : 'XXXXXXXXXX',\r\n    'KISSmetrics'      : 'XXXXXXXXXX'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nDid we mention this means you never need to mess with analytics snippets again? Bonus!\r\n\r\nYou can also choose to pass in extra, service-specific options to enable certain advanced features. Check out the [service-specific](#service-specific-settings) reference for details. That looks like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nanalytics.initialize({\r\n    'Google Analytics' : {\r\n        tracking_id : 'UA-XXXXXX-XX',\r\n        enhanced_link_attribution : false\r\n    },\r\n    'KISSmetrics' : {\r\n        api_key : 'XXXXXXXXXXX'\r\n    },\r\n    'Mixpanel' : {\r\n        token : 'XXXXXXXXXXX',\r\n        people : true\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### identify()\r\nIdentify is how you tie a user to their actions:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nanalytics.identify('achilles@segment.io', {\r\n    subscription_plan : 'Gold',\r\n    friend_count      : 29\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ `userId` _string_ - is the ID you refer to your user by.\r\n+ `traits` _object, optional_ - is an _optional_ dictionary of things you know about the user. Things like: **Subscription Plan**, **Friend Count**, **Age**, etc.\r\n\r\nWe usually recommend using a backend template to inject an identify with the `userId` straight into the footer of every page of your application. That way no matter what page the user lands on, the call is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n### track()\r\nTrack is how you record the actions your users take. Whenever your using does something you want to record, `track` that event. The API looks like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nanalytics.track('Purchased an Item', {\r\n    price           : 40.20,\r\n    shipping_method : '2-day'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ `event` _string_ - is the name of the event.\r\n+ `properties` _object, optional_ - is an _optional_ dictionary of properties for the event. If the event was **Added to Shopping Cart**, it might have properties like **Price**, **Product Category**, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to use analytics.js\r\n\r\n1. Grab the latest version of **analytics.js** from this repo and add it to your project.\r\n\r\n1. Initialize **analytics.js** with the services you want to use.\r\n\r\n1. Add an `analytics.identify()` call to tag your user and some `analytics.track()` calls for the events you want to record.\r\n\r\n1. That's it! You're recording data to all your providers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n#### Where should I put the identify call?\r\nWe usually recommend using a backend template to inject an identify with the `userId` straight into the footer of every page of your application. That way no matter what page the user lands on, the call is made.\r\n\r\n#### What traits should I record?\r\nThe single most important trait to record is something like **Membership Level** or **Subscription Type** or however you break your users into different tiers. That way, you can focus on getting people into the higher tiers.\r\n\r\nOther things you might want to **identify** are things like **Friend Count**, **Company**, **Business Type**, **Employee Count**, etc.\r\n\r\n#### What events should I track?\r\nThe best way to figure out what events to track is to ask your to questions: \"what do I want my users to do more of?\" and \"what do i want my users to do less of?\". For example:\r\n\r\n+ Complete Purchase\r\n+ Upgrade Plan\r\n+ Share on Facebook\r\n+ Watche a Video\r\n+ Invite a Friend\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n+ Cancel their Account\r\n+ Unsuscribe\r\n+ Downgrade Plan\r\n+ Leave Negative Review\r\n\r\n#### Google Analytics doesn't have traits! ... Intercom doesn't have events!\r\nThat's all right. If a provider doesn't handle a certain method, you can still call it and nothing will break. You don't have to worry about anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nWe love contributions! If you have a provider you'd like to add, feel free to submit a pull request. Providers are community maintained! You can check out the providers that we've already written for guidance. (Make sure to add tests!)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Provider-specific Settings\r\n\r\n### Google Analtyics\r\n\r\n+ `trackingId` _string_ - your project's \"Tracking ID\".\r\n+ `enhancedLinkAttribution` _boolean, optional_ - whether or not to use Google Analytics' [Enhanced Link Attribution](http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2558867) feature. Defaults to `false`.\r\n+ `siteSpeedSampleRate` _integer, optional_ - the value to use for Google Analytics' [Site Speed Sample Rate](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/methods/gaJSApiBasicConfiguration#_gat.GA_Tracker_._setSiteSpeedSampleRate) feature. Google's default is 1%.\r\n\r\n\r\n### KISSmetrics\r\n\r\n+ `apiKey` - your project's \"API key\".\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mixpanel\r\n\r\n+ `token` _string_ - your project's \"token\".\r\n+ `people` _boolean, optional_ - whether you want to use Mixpanel's [People](https://mixpanel.com/people/) feature. Defaults to `false`.\r\n\r\n_All settings are also passed directly to the second argument of Mixpanel's `init` method._\r\n\r\n\r\n### Intercom\r\n\r\n+ `appId` _string_ - your project's \"App ID\".\r\n\r\n### Olark\r\nNo, Olark isn't an analytics provider. But if you have it installed, whenever you call `identify` the Olark chat will update the visitors name, so that you know who you're talking to!\r\n\r\n+ `siteId` _string_ - your project's \"Site-ID\".\r\n+ `track` _boolean, optional_ - whether to log every track call in the operator's Olark chat. This can be useful to know what your users are doing as you're chatting with them, but it can also be overwhelming. Defaults to `false`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Chartbeat\r\n\r\n+ `uid` _string_ - your project's \"User ID\".\r\n\r\n_All of Chartbeat's [Configuration Variables](http://chartbeat.com/docs/configuration_variables) (`path`, `title`, `domain`, `useCanonical`, `sections`, `authors`, `noCookies`) are also passed directly to Chartbeat's configuration._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License (MIT)\r\n\r\n```\r\nWWWWWW||WWWWWW\r\n W W W||W W W\r\n      ||\r\n    ( OO )__________\r\n     /  |           \\\r\n    /o o|    MIT     \\\r\n    \\___/||_||__||_|| *\r\n         || ||  || ||\r\n        _||_|| _||_||\r\n       (__|__|(__|__|\r\n```\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Segment.io\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
