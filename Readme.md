# Analytics.js

Analytics.js makes it easy to collect customer data and send it to many different tools using a single, unified API.

Analytics.js is open source and is one of the libraries that powers [Segment](https://segment.com), the managed, hassle-free way to collect customer data in the browser and beyond.
