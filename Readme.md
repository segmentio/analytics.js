analytics.js
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/segmentio/analytics.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/segmentio/analytics.js)

The hassle-free way to integrate analytics into any web application. [See the docs.](https://segment.io/libraries/analytics.js/)

Looking for an _even_ easier way to setup analytics on your website? [Check out Segment.io!](https://segment.io) It's our hosted solution that lets you add analytics services without touching any code at all.

Building
------------

Analytics.js is packaged as a [component](https://github.com/component/component). In order to build it, you will need to install component:

```shell
npm install -g component
```

We've already packaged the files as a standalone build found in `analytics.js` and `analytics.min.js`. To build the files yourself, run `make`.
